Executive Summary: Impact of Trade Factors on GDP

The final, robust regression model finds a statistically significant negative relationship between Customs Duties/GDP and GDP Growth. Simplifying the model by removing highly correlated, insignificant variables (TRADE OPENESS/GDP and NET X/GDP) was critical to achieving reliable results.

The single-predictor model using only CUSTOM/GDP is the most robust and parsimonious (simple yet effective) model for this dataset.
The core finding is clear and reliable: Higher customs duties/tariffs (relative to GDP) are strongly and reliably associated with lower GDP growth.

1.Initial Findings and Model Diagnostics:Conclusion of Initial Stage: The model suffered from severe multicollinearity, meaning the effects of CUSTOM/GDP and TRADE OPENESS/GDP could not be statistically separated

2. Model Refinement and Final Results
To correct the high multicollinearity, the two insignificant variables (TRADE OPENESS/GDP and NET X/GDP) were removed, leading to the final, parsimonious model using only CUSTOM/GDP.

3.Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) and Multicollinearity
Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) and Multicollinearity match and explains the challenges and steps taken in regression analyses.
The data you provided here (VIF scores and Normality Tests) supports the high multicollinearity and justifies the model simplification that was performed.

4. Final Diagnostic Check
-Durbin-Watson: 1.492
oThis is still close to 1.5, which is slightly elevated but generally acceptable
-Normality (Prob(Omnibus): 0.551): The residuals are still normally distributed, confirming the standard OLS assumptions
